## How to Squarsh Your Thirst

Were you blessed with a jug of Mucker's Milk? **Why you lucky mucker!**

You been in the bottom of the hole mucking all day? Well, it's time to get your **squarsh** on like it's 1864:

1. Put down that shovel.
1. Crawl towards the light!
2. Loosen your suspenders.
3. Spit the grit out your mouth.

### Tailings Tea (On the Rocks)

- Ice cubes*
- And don't be stingy with the Mucker's Milk

\* Use fresh-blasted ore instead for the original Four Georgian's flavor.

### Fire in the Hole!

- Hot coffee or cocoa
- Generous glug-glug of Mucker's Milk

### Sluice Juice

- Ice
- Root beer
- Mmmmm mmmm Mucker's Milk

## The Squashtown Toast

Clank cups with your muckers. Cup to table for muckers lost. **"SquashDOWN!"**
