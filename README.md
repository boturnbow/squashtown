## What in the Sam Hill is Squashtown?

A golden opportunity squandered. Montana's oldest dad joke. And superior to Pumpkinville in every way.

To hell with ~~Queen City of the Rockies~~, we want our [Squashtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena,_Montana#Early_settlement_and_gold_rush)!

## How to Squarsh Your Thirst

Were you blessed with a jug of Mucker's Milk? **Why you lucky mucker!** It's time to get out of that mucking hole and get your **squarsh** on like it's 1864:

1. Put down that shovel.
1. Crawl towards the light!
3. Spit the grit out your mouth.
4. Pick your poison.

### Tailings Tea (On the Rocks)

- Ice*
- And don't be stingy with the Mucker's Milk

\* Substitute fresh-blasted ore for that original Four Georgian's flavor.

### Fire in the Hole!

- Hot coffee or cocoa
- Generous glug, glug, glug of Mucker's Milk

### Sluice Juice

- Ice
- Root beer
- Pour that mmmmm mmmm Mucker's Milk

## The Squashtown Toast

Clank cups with your muckers. And cup to table for muckers lost.

**"SquashDOWN!"**

## Squash for Squash's Sake
