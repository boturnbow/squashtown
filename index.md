# Yo Yo Helena!

## What in the Sam Hill is Squashtown?

A golden opportunity squandered. Montana's oldest dad joke &mdash; 1864! And superior to Pumpkinville in every way.

To hell with ~~Queen City of the Rockies~~, we want our [Squashtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena,_Montana#Early_settlement_and_gold_rush)!

## Christmas in Squashtown /<br>How to Squarsh Your Thirst

Were you blessed with a jug of Mucker's Milk? **Why you lucky mucker!** It's time to get out of that mucking hole and get your **squarsh** on like it's 1864:

1. Put down that mucking shovel.
1. Crawl towards the light.
3. Spit the mucking grit out your mouth.
4. Pick your poison and make that **loudmouth soup**!

### Tailings Tea / On the Rocks

- Ice (or substitute fresh-blasted ore for that original Four Georgian's flavor)
- Let flow the Mucker's Milk

### Fire in the Hole!

- Hot coffee or cocoa
- Glug, glug, glug that Mucker's Milk

### Sluice Juice

- Ice
- Root beer
- Dose with mmmmm mmmm Mucker's Milk

## The Squashtown Toast

Clank cups with your muckers. Cup to table for muckers lost.

**"SquashDOWN!"**

## Squash for Squash's Sake
