# Yo Yo Helena!

## What in the Sam Hill is Squashtown?

* A *golden* opportunity squandered.
* Montana's oldest **dad joke** &mdash; 1864!
* Superior to Pumpkinville in every way.
* The beginning of a movement. :eggplant:

To hell with ~~Queen City of the Rockies~~, we want our [Squashtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena,_Montana#Early_settlement_and_gold_rush)!

## Just Tell Me Already!

Well, on **October 30, 1864** - the day before Halloween (that's important), the citizens of Last Chance had a meeting to rename and perchance gentrify their little burg. Maybe the name *Last Chance* was depressing them? Or maybe it was the dark hours spent mucking in the bottom of a mine shaft? Anywho. Of the 200 hard-scrabbling miner folk living here, seven owners of seven pairs of blistered hands got together and had what would at times be a cantakerous shouting match as Civil War rivalries reared up. Providing comic relief to all the hubbub, some **goofy dads** in the crowd proposed "Squashtown" and "Pumpkinville" as names for the town (Halloween time, remember). **Oh the sublime and transporting humor of a dad joke!** I'm sure that pistols were holstered, knives sheathed and cudgels pocketed as the tensions were guffawed away. Unfortunately, the muddle-headed crowd settled on the name *Helena*. And we now live with weak puns like "What the Helena?" and "Have a Helena Day".

But ... just imagine the parallel universe spawned that day (the Squashaverse&#8482; if you will) where our fair city was
named ***Squashtown***. Butternuts and chayotes living in harmony. A gourd in every pot. The amazing punnery and double entendres!!! All while living in a Squasher's Paradise.

As for the other squash-related name proposed that day - **up yours, Pumpkinville!** :confounded:
